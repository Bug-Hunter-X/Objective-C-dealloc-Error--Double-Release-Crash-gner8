In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error stems from the misuse of `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` within custom `dealloc` methods.  Specifically, prematurely releasing objects referenced by the receiver can cause crashes or unexpected behavior.

For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject {
    MyOtherClass *otherObject;
}

-(void)dealloc {
    [otherObject release]; // Incorrect if otherObject is also retained elsewhere
    [super dealloc];
}
```

If `otherObject` is retained by another object, releasing it in `MyClass`'s `dealloc` will lead to a double release. This can cause a program crash.
