The solution lies in carefully managing object ownership. Only release objects that are exclusively owned by the receiver.  If another object retains a reference, avoid releasing it in `dealloc`.  Consider using `weak` properties to prevent retain cycles, or relying on Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to avoid manual memory management altogether. For this example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject {
    MyOtherClass *otherObject;
}

-(void)dealloc {
    otherObject = nil; // ARC safe way to release, no need for manual release. 
    [super dealloc]; // ARC should handle this cleanup if manually implemented
}
```

Or, if using ARC, simply remove `dealloc` method entirely; ARC handles memory management automatically.
